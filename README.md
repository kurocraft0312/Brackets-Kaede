# Brackets-Kaede
"Brackets-Kaede" is a customization theme plug-in that can be used with the source code editor "Brackets".

I made a model with virtual river Higuchi Kaede of the affiliated company as a model, and the color of the editor screen selected an orange-like color close to the image color of the character.

By the way, this theme is an informal theme.
